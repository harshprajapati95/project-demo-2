# Admin Authentication System - Complete Setup Guide

## Overview
The EduHub system now has a complete admin authentication system that restricts file upload and delete operations to authenticated administrators only. Regular users can still browse and download content.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Admin Authentication Backend
- **JWT-based authentication** with bcrypt password hashing
- **Admin schema** in MongoDB with username, email, and password fields
- **Authentication middleware** that protects upload/delete routes
- **Token verification** endpoint for frontend validation

### 2. Admin Interface Pages
- **Admin Setup Page** (`/admin-setup.html`) - For creating the first admin account
- **Admin Login Page** (`/admin-login.html`) - For admin authentication
- **Password strength validation** and form validation

### 3. Protected Operations
- **File Upload** - Only authenticated admins can upload content
- **File Delete** - Only authenticated admins can delete content
- **Content Browsing** - Available to all users (no authentication required)

### 4. Frontend Integration
- **Dynamic navigation** showing admin controls when logged in
- **Upload modal** with comprehensive form for content management
- **Delete buttons** appear only for authenticated admins
- **Auto token verification** on page load

- **Full access** to all educational content

### For Administrators
- **Secure login process** with form validation
- **Upload modal** with comprehensive content management
- **Delete controls** with confirmation dialogs
- **Admin badge** and special navigation options

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Please login as admin first" error**
   - Solution: Navigate to `/admin-login.html` and log in

2. **Upload fails with authentication error**
   - Solution: Check if admin token is valid, re-login if necessary

3. **Delete buttons not visible**
   - Solution: Ensure you're logged in as admin and refresh the page

4. **Admin setup page shows error**
   - Solution: Check server connection and MongoDB status

### Admin Account Management

1. **Forgot admin password**
   - Currently requires database-level password reset
   - Future versions will include password reset functionality

2. **Multiple admin accounts**
   - Additional admin accounts can be created through the setup page
   - Each admin has full privileges

## Next Steps

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Password Reset**: Email-based password recovery
